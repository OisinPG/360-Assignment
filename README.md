Team members: James Escudero, Mankirat Singh Mann, Oisin Perkins-Gilbert

James: There wasn't any issues at all for me. Quite a review and a referesher.

Oisin: We've done things in Git before, but not in GitBash. Working with the command line is cool, but I prefer using the other tools I have to mess with Github because it's a little more intuitive. Overall, wasn't too bad. Most issues I had were solved with Googling (mainly just not knowing the commands).
